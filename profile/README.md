# ou-ecolab 
This organization is intended to collect all repositories necessary for an ecopad installation.
The code is spread out into different repositories, since some parts are useable in more
general contexts (cybercommons framework).
To get an overview how the different components work together go to  the repo containing the [Documentation](https://github.com/ou-ecolab/ecopad_documentation).
Nethertheless the parts depend on each other, so that an installation that is guaranteed to work will have to coordinate 
changes to different repositories. 
This task is assumed by an [umbrella repo](https://github.com/ou-ecolab/ecopad) that contains the contributing repos as git [submodules](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules)
